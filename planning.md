## Considerations

- What should the first js project be? 
- Should the class be fully flipped?
- Should i use webpack or not: Maybe this: https://github.com/LaksForks/vanilla-js-boilerplate. Yes i should use web pack
- Write some boilerplate code for the authorization part. Maybe just use Tomas Pesek's (https://github.com/pesekt1/SWC3-React-Frontend/tree/3ee22db77f1399411e58fc34da5f6905b2839df5/src/services). Maybe also other parts of the project

## Homeworks

1. One after Array mehods. Not seperate project week!
2. One after async that they will be working with for 1.5 weeks. Should be handed in as much time before react as is possible
3.
