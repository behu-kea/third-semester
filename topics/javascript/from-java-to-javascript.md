# From java to Javascript



Learning to write javascript after having written Java for more that a year can be quite challenging. 

Things can seem quite vague, functions act super weird, asynchronous code makes no sense and sometimes js just behaves a bit weird

If you feel like this, then dont worry i am here to help

This introduction should prepare you for the shift



## Functional programming language

Javascript is a functional language. That means that code and structure in js is built up using functions. In Java Classes are used to build structure, but in js that is mainly functions. 



## Dynamically typed

Javascript is dynamically typed. This means that you dont need to define the type you are working with js tries to figure that out ðŸ˜±



- Functional programming language
- Dynamically typed - there are types, but you dont need to specify them!
  - Const, let
  - number
  - string
  - boolean
  - undefined
  - null
  - Typeof
- Equality operator! ===
- Not compiled
- ArrayList is just array. No sets, trees
  - accesses with []
- HashMap is now called dictionary (and its a fuck ton easier to work with)
  - accessed with .keyname og ['keyname']
- Js has this but its tricky!
- No enum
- Supports classes and inheritance but please avoid it. Use objects instead
- Functions are just variables
- Prints done with console.log()
