## Build a sentiment analyzer

A sentiment analyzer is some functionality that figures out how positive/negative a sentence is. 

Fx the sentence `I am mega super awesome happy` Should have a high score
The sentence `I hate doing boring stuff` should have a low score.

Create a function that takes a string as a parameter. calling the function will return an object with `score`, `positiveWords` and `negativeWords`. You decide how the score should be implemented and what words you characterise as negative and positive.

Here is an example of using the function:

```js
const sentimentScoreObject = getSentimentScore('I am mega super awesome happy');

console.log(sentimentScoreObject); 
/*
{
  score: 3,
  positiveWords: ['happy', 'awesome', 'super'],
  negativeWords: [],
}
*/
```
