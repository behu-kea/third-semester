# Lecture 17

This first week will be focused on you learning the syntax of Javascript but also the differences between javascript and java. 

All the concepts should by this time be very familiar to you. You will be working with types, operators, conditionals, loops, functions and scope. So what you need to learn is not the concept behind (cause you already know those) but more figuring out how to do those things in Javascript. 

The only new thing that you will learn is the concept of an `object`. But since an `object` is exactly the same as a `HashMap` again the concept should not be foreign for you. 



## How you should study this week

Go through all the topics in the learning goals, and focus on doing the exercises. If you struggle with the exercise, then read through the description of the topic you are studying. If things are too easy then skip them. 

For some of you it would maybe even make sense to just go straight into the later exercises. Then you will probably stumble into somthing you dont know how to do. Now you can use the topics, read up on what you were struggling with, maybe do one or two exercises with that topic and then coming back to solve the final exercise. 

By now you probably have an idea of how you study the best so use that! After this week i expect you to know how to work with basic js. 

From next week we will have more traditional learning goals üëç
