# Frontend project

The frontend project is a project where you get to show your frontend skills. 



It is up to you what project you would like to do. I have some suggestions below



## Requirements

### Technical Requirements

- Uses routing using Navigo. Check this site that shows how to do different kinds of routing: https://github.com/behu-kea/navigo-routing-simple
  You can use it as a boilerplate (starter code) for your project. 
- Fetches some data from an api
- Uses some array methods (`forEach`, `filter`, `map`)
- The project should be deployed on https://surge.sh/



### Projects based requirements

- The project can be made alone or in groups
- If you hand in as a group then you need to comment who has written the code! There is off course code you wrote together that is fine (but also comment that in the code). But there need to be contributions from every team member



## Project suggestions

- An app where you get a sentence you need to type. Based on the speed you get a score. You could let yourself be inspired by this: https://typethealphabet.app/
- Create a one button game
- Create an online drummachine. You could get inspired by this: https://www.musicca.com/drum-machine
- Make a website where you can see and search for airport codes. You can get inspired by: https://airportcod.es/
- Make an online avatar creator. kind of like this site: https://davidrose.style/
- Create a site that makes you create art in a canvas
- Create a site that on purpose has awful UI! Get inspired by this site: https://userinyerface.com/
- Your idea here. It's up to you. Create something fun, quirky, beautiful, funny, weird, cool. Whatever. As long as you fulfill the requirements!
