# Fullstack project



Earlier this semester, you all created a backend for a cinema administration system, initially presented with this description

*We have signed an initial contract with the Cinema-XX chain to deliver a prototype backend server that can handle ticket sales for all their cinemas in Denmark.*



*Cinema-xx is a franchise based company with more than 70 cinema theaters all over Denmark. Locally each theater (each with typically more than one cinema hall) can have many activities which are not all directly related to the cinema business.* 

*So it's essential to the franchise based cinemas, that they can set up their own WEB-pages. As such, this contract is related only to a backend-API that can handle ticket sales, show future movies etc.*

*Today, ticket sales are handled differently by most franchise holders (phone, electronic, face to face etc.) often with different backend solutions. For Cinema-XX it's important in the future that they can offer a standard solution to all members of the chain.*

*Find full original start description here:* [*https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lfO3gUHNhCpbTFDh4G6-WoYFXxV5ywUyiGCn6JSs9WM/edit?usp=sharing*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lfO3gUHNhCpbTFDh4G6-WoYFXxV5ywUyiGCn6JSs9WM/edit?usp=sharing) 



## Now it's time to focus on the frontend

This time we won't do this tightly connected to SYS, but we do expect that you develop the project over 2 mini sprints where your team must fulfill all the SCRUM-roles including product owner.



By the end of each sprint you must deliver the following:

- A link to your github repos

- A link to your **hosted** frontend

- A link to your **hosted** backend

- A link to a short video (max 10 min) where you should explain 
  - Who did what
  - How you have structured the code
  - A demo of the features implemented in this sprint


You can add all links and requested info in your README file, and just hand in a single link to the groups github repo.



So we will have two handins in this project

1. **Sunday the 5/12** - Result of the first sprint
2. **Sunday the 12/12** - Result of second and final sprint. This will be the final project



## What you have to do

Assume that a single theater with three movie halls, in Holb√¶k, want's a proof of concept for a web frontend that uses the API created for Cinema-x.

As explained above, for this part you act also as your own product owner, so what you do will depend on what your backend offers. But the following are **suggestions** for user-stories you could implement.



- Add, edit movies, schedule times for specific movies in specific theater halls

- Let users see all movies playing today, in this week, or a period.

- Let users reserve tickets for a specific show.

- Let user see all available seat for a show (so they can reserve seats)
- Create a welcome page showing info about both the cinema and the movies playing



If your backend offers secured endpoints, add security where it makes sense.



### Requirements



#### Technical Requirements

- Uses routing using Navigo in the frontend. Check this site that shows how to do different kinds of routing: https://github.com/behu-kea/navigo-routing-simple
  You can use it as a boilerplate (starter code) for your project. 
- Fetches some data from the api you created in Springboot
- The backend and the frontend should be deployed, working and talking to each other. **Remember to test this early!**



#### Projects based requirements

- The project can be made alone or in groups
- If you hand in as a group then you need to comment who has written the code! There is off course code you wrote together that is fine (but also comment that in the code). But there need to be contributions from every team member





## Feedback

The final project will get feedback from Benjamin. It will be focused on the frontend



## Handin

- First sprint handin **Sunday the 5/12**: [https://kea-fronter.itslearning.com/LearningToolElement/ViewLearningToolElement.aspx?LearningToolElementId=947720](https://kea-fronter.itslearning.com/LearningToolElement/ViewLearningToolElement.aspx?LearningToolElementId=947720)
- Second sprint handin **Sunday the 12/12**: [https://kea-fronter.itslearning.com/LearningToolElement/ViewLearningToolElement.aspx?LearningToolElementId=947725](https://kea-fronter.itslearning.com/LearningToolElement/ViewLearningToolElement.aspx?LearningToolElementId=947725)
